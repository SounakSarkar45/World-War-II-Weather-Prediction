The dataset contains information on weather conditions recorded on each day at various weather stations around the world. Information includes precipitation, snowfall, temperatures, wind speed and whether the day included thunder storms or other poor weather conditions. The World War II Weather prediction project employed a Polynomial Regression model, achieving a commendable accuracy of 80%. The Polynomial Regression algorithm demonstrated its efficacy in capturing nonlinear relationships between weather predictors and forecasting historical weather conditions. This accuracy level indicates the potential of using Polynomial Regression for weather prediction tasks. Although further improvements could be explored, the achieved accuracy provides valuable insights for understanding the complex dynamics of weather patterns during the World War II era. This project opens avenues for future research and application of Polynomial Regression in historical weather analysis and forecasting.
